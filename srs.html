Introduction

Purpose 

The purpose with creating a website that allows users of a website to find every type shoe that comes to market all in one spot instead of having to go to multiple places this would let shoe connoisseurs as well as regular buyers find their favorite shoes or find new shoes that they haven’t seen or been able to find in years in an environment for users to do online shopping. Allowing the customers to our full inventory of shoes and able to find their exact sizes. Then after the customer has chosen their shoes they are guided to the payment / shipping screen and then provides the customer with their tracking number 

Document Conventions

The special significance is when you first arrive you are guided to the fade away website you will see a moonlit website screen backdrop multiple new release and deals going on at this time 20% off deals with purchase of one hundred dollars them it has a spot light VIP section for the members and new members. We need continues images and brands that the customers can view.

Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions

The intended audience would be regular common people as well as shoe fanatics this allows all ages to get involved on the website it has an inventory for all ages and all sizes. This maximizes the consumers / people able to use the website more easily to navigate around the website, so kids and elders can understand how to go through the browsing the website with ease.

Project Scope

The project scope the developer would have to code for creating a system that categorizes the different variation of shoes from the genre of shoes to the brand to the exact style that we have in the inventory after that is chosen giving the users a subclass of variation of color choices. After that it should allow the user to select the shoes and head to the checkout process where they would collect card information as well as shipping once that is done giving the user a tracking number that they can use to track their order until it arrives to them. 



References

The references for this would be the different shoe designers and companies and having links to their website for authenticity of products and inventory this allows the users to see where the inventory is being collected from and it shows the designers the partnership between their and my company

Overall Description


Product Perspective

The origins behind Fade Away is from multiple business software and libraries and the difference between them and fade away is it eliminates the different places customers must go for a specific shoe fade away’s will have every variety from those websites all in one website 

User Classes and Characteristics

There is a membership in portion call locker room and this is for frequent users the more they buy the different level of member they are the first starting locker membership position would start rookie   so the user would be welcomed with a small perk for membership like a free shipping on an item of 200 or more. The second stage is all-star membership this is for users who have purchase at least $600 dollars in material from fade away this comes with larger perks such ass $100 dollars off on tour next purchase with the purchase of at least $200 and free shipping on all items. Then there is gold membership this is for your more high-end shoppers with over $1000 dollars of material purchase from fade away this membership gets them access to a large perk which could range from buy one get one free they are the first person to be informed on all new sales as well as free overnight shipping. 

Operating Environment.

My website will be running on the world wide web it will be found under the website name fade away .com and anyone who has internet access can reach the website it is compatible with all phones, tablets and devices. I will be running the website using html and my invoice and expenses software 

Design and Implementation Constraints

Hacking is always one major part of issues that can occur when having a website on the internet and pop ups that can occur when getting on the website so making sure there is firewalls to protect the user’s devices as well as information such as credit card information and mailing address. There will be a policy that each person will be asked to agree with when finalizing purchase stating that the information given is theirs and complete from any fraudulent information saying that fade away cannot be responsible for any fraudulent purchasing. Then there is a return policy we do not accept any returns after 7 days of receiving the package and we do not reimburse money they are credited money back onto their locker room and they are able to purchase other items up to the amount they have been accredited and before money is sent to locker room there is a n inspection of the product. 

User Documentation

There will be a help center as well as an 1800 number that can be contacted if here are any questions or concerns about products or how to navigate the website the number gives the users the choice of pressing number 1 – this tells the user that if they have a problem with tracking package or shipping, pressing number 2- is for customers who are having trouble navigating through the website and there are some steps that will be sent to the screen on how to get everywhere on the website. When pressing number 3 – this is for any type of returns it informs the user of our return policy and how to go about returning the property the information will be in the corner of the website once accessed 


Assumptions and Dependencies

The companies that fade Away partner with major dependencies they are the manufactures that get my inventory from their inventory so on the website each company manufacture that is being used gets their recognition for their contributions by having their brand mane sponsored on the bottom of the webpage 




3.1	System Feature 1



3.1.1	Description and Priority

	The priorities of orders of course come into play so we a will have a priority list and use a priority fit algorithm to organize the system This will allow diamond members to purchase to be sent out in a quicker fashion then a new customer 



3.1.2	Stimulus/Response Sequences

	< The basic user action is when the customer gets to the website and is guided through the website if it is their first time on the website the first pop up window the user will encounter is a small window that says click yes or no if this is your first time on Fade Away’s. Once yes is pressed it shows you where to go to type in your type of shoe of it also allows you to browse the inventory. Then once shoes have been chosen it takes the guest to an information/payment window from there it gives the user the tracking number then ask the guy if they wanted to browse again. 



3.1.3	Functional Requirements

	


<Itemize the detailed functional requirements associated with this feature. These are the software capabilities that must be present for the user to carry out the services provided by the feature, or to execute the use case. Include how the product should respond to anticipated error conditions or invalid inputs. Requirements should be concise, complete, unambiguous, verifiable, and necessary. Use “TBD” as a placeholder to indicate when necessary information is not yet available.>

	

	<Each requirement should be uniquely identified with a sequence number or a meaningful tag of some kind.>

	

REQ-1: priority algorithm for the system to run 	

REQ-2: A real time / batch system 

REQ-3 customer welcome screen 

REQ-4	then browsing screen 

Req-5 having smart business software program to regulate inventory (Running their invoices and estimate system to run for all inventory through the store)

4. External Interface Requirements

4.1User Interfaces


The functions would be Men’s, Women, Kids, sign in, deals once one of the functions is pushed then they are broken into sub classes which will have specifications for products such as (Style, Brand, Color) also create buttons that will have some of the following functions (home) this takes the user back to the fade away start page. Another button would include the (help/customer support) function this allows users to go step by step to get an issue resolved as well as gives the user a customer services specialist to walk them through the website to find exactly what the customer is looking for. There is Another function which is browse which allows the user to view the inventory once item has been selected it sends the information to Checkout window where the customer is provided with a total amount of their item and shipping and handling price. Once they have finalized their selection it brings them to the payment screen where the user is aske for credit card or PayPal information as well as shipping address. Then it gives the user a ticket number and a tracking number for their package 

4.2Hardware Interfaces

The system runs on the internet, so most software devices are already compatible to our software only needs the customer to have access to an internet connection. It is compatible with Microsoft products (phones, tablets, computers, Video games) as well as Apple Products (apple tv, apple watches, cell phones, iPad,) The software is compatible to every device connected to internet  

4.3Software Interfaces

The shoe database would be a combination of multiple shoe libraries it would include the inventory storage of every company in partnership with fade Away’s. The system will be running off a c++ program. Tis data will be shared with the different companies but only their inventory items will be seen by that company the shoes were manufactured from. The system must be able to hold an infinite number of processes from the number of users shopping on the website at one time. The browser is compatible with Firefox, safari, Chrome, and Internet Explorer



4.4Communications Interfaces

Once item has been purchasing customers immediately need to be sent emails and product calculators for shopping next time. the standard that is being used is HTTP also all data is sent through multi cloud processors for processing and storing information for future business and to keep records of purchases made. 

Other Nonfunctional Requirements

Performance Requirements

A real-time system that regulates inventory every minute helps us as consumers as well as customers we both need to receive the inventory list always alerts the customers of inventory status. When the home button is pressed it should take no more than 5 seconds to take the customer to the welcome page. When customers go to the checkout process it should alert them that they have 10 minutes to proceed to the next screen before considers them inactive user. Once processed it should show the user their immediate routing number  


Safety Requirements

Must have a security system for the customers personal information and once an Item is returned the customer will be given the credit on their account and can purchase another item or wait for our system to return money back to their cards and that takes 5-7 business days week for payment to be refunded if the merchandise doesn’t return in resalable condition the customer will then be resent the merchandise 

Security Requirements

We will need to run a security scan the system every 5 seconds to ensure that there is no information that is every stolen also having an encryption system for card information as well as delivery information have the system verify their information twice for security and delivery reassurance Once a threat is detected Multiple firewalls go into action to prevent the hacked from seeing any additional information and it alerts the it department to change security clearance codes  



Software Quality Attributes is regulated every 5 seconds to ensure the utmost efficiency when using the website and locating your product availability every day at 2 a.m. there will be a scan run on the system for any bugs or corrupt material on the website. 




System will have a real-time system so this would alert customers of inventory status this

Other Requirements

Requirements are established PayPal account for users willing to purchase through that method 

Set Shipping price from Fade Away factory to customer (delivery time
